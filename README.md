## A collection of pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic (PK–PD) modeling examples in R, including:

Population PK simulation

Indirect response models

Target-Mediated Drug Disposition (TMDD)

PBPK modeling

Steady-state Probability of Target Attainment (PTA)

nlmixr2 fitting examples

This repository serves as a computational sandbox for exposure–response modeling and decision-oriented dose selection analysis.
